# StreamCo Coding challenge

http://streamco-coding-challenge.herokuapp.com/

This challenge was completed with Ruby on Rails.

Also see http://robj.github.io for en example of Test Driven Development of a Versioned, RESTful API


## Application

Run with:

`# rails server`


`/Gemfile`

Additional gems used

- request_exception_handler (rescue JSON Parsing errors)
- curb (test broken JSON with raw requests)



`/config/routes.rb`

- Setup of root route (POST / -> ShowFilters create action)


`/app/controllers/application_controller.rb`

- JSON ParseError exception handling


`/app/controllers/show_filters_controller.rb`

- ShowFilter controller logic


`/app/models/show.rb`

- In a real world actual application, Shows, Images, Episodes etc. would all be ActiveRecord models with relational associations. For simplification in this challenge, the Show Model is a PORO (Plain Old Ruby Object)
- Some ActiveRecord 'behaviours' are emulated (initialization with hash, and type casting in cases the model would have had non-String field types. ie. episodeCount (Integer) and drm (Boolean).
- The Class method 'has_episodes_and_drm' would be the equivalant of a database scope (WHERE query).
- Also in a real world application the Instance method to_json would better be represented by a Serializer (eg. ActiveModelSerializers) to seperate presentation concerns.


## Tests

Run with:

` ruby -Itest test/integration/show_integration_test.rb `




`/test/minitest_helper.rb`

- Basic MiniTest setup and support

`/test/integration/show_integration_test.rb`

- Test sending the exact JSON example payload. NB JSON.parse in this test will add quotes to all values, loosing type information. TypeCasting is performed server side for neccessary fields.
- Test 400 error message on bad request 

`/test/example_payload.json`

- The example payload


### Thoughts on improving the design of the tests API to align with RESTful principles / standardisation ( http://jsonapi.org )

- POST to /shows for each individual show instead of a single bulk POST request ShowsController#create) , return 201 Created, singular show root

   show: { title: 'a', image: 'b', slug: 'c' }

- Creating many requests in parallel would probably be more effiecient in a real world scenario with a pool of api servers, is RESTful, and a bad validation of a single show does not invalidate all shows as when posted in bulk.
- return 422 Unprocessable Entity on validation errrors, more specific than bad request.

- Seperate GET request to get filtered Shows.
- GET on the show collection with query params 
 
    GET /shows?episodeCount.gte=1&drm=true 

    respond with status 200 OK,  plural shows root with array

    shows: [ { title: 'a', image: 'b', slug: 'c' },
             { title: 'd', image: 'e', slug: 'f' } 
           ]
